# Week 4: An Introdution to Gaussian Processes

Gaussian Processes (GPs) are incredibly versitle predictors for both regression and classification tasks.
They are often considered the gold standard ML technique, due to their ability 
to capture uncertainty in the data. 

The following is a very good, yet basic introduction to Gaussian Processes, 
Read the tutorial and transfer the code into your own jupyter notebook.

The next tutorial is how to utilise an existing framework called Scikit-Learn.
Scikit-learn is a fantastic library, full of all the most useful unsupervised (clustering methods) supervised (Random forests, GPs, Linear regression etc) learning methods, and enables users to easily utilise them 
by making simple function calls. 
Follow this tutorial and run it in a jupyter notebook, you have already installed Scikit-learn :
[Scikit-learn GP tutorial](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/gaussian_process/plot_gpr_noisy_targets.html) and [Here}(https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/gaussian_process/plot_gpr_prior_posterior.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-gaussian-process-plot-gpr-prior-posterior-py)
